[Futurice Tech Weeklies](https://techweeklies.futurice.com/) is a weekly event at Futurice where developers
from all our offices in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and UK are sharing their
experience with various frameworks, languages, techniques, services and projects.

In this case I reused the existing content and API to develop and Alexa Skill. The user is able to listen
to the audio of these talks and can navigate forward or backwards through the talks. The skill will also
remember the last played talk and in case it wasn't finished it will ask whether you want to resume it.

It was a nice experience to learn a new technology and platform where the user communication happens
through voice and not through a screen like we are all used.

With the practice from this project and after studying a bit more about the Alexa platform I was able to pass the
AWS Alexa Skill Builder certification.
