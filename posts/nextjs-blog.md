In order to prepare for a project I was told to learn **NestJS** but instead I understood **NextJS**. I realized it
 a bit late and by that time I had alrerady finished their tutorial which helps to create a personal blog. This blog
 is the one you are currently looking at.
 
 **NextJS** is a React framework and helps building apps without much configuration. Provides out of the box hybrid static
 & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
 
 **NestJS** on the other side is a Node.js framework that helps to build scalable server-side applications.
