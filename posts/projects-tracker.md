This is a project that was created with the idea to track the health of the projects within my company. This is just an
initial version which I open sourced, but I kept working on an internal version.

It was inspired by [Project Canvas](http://www.projectcanvas.dk/) and the purpose is to keep track of how are projects
doing. In this case we want to track the team members, how are they feeling, workload, learning, satisfaction, etc.
