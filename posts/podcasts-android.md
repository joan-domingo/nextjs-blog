In order to learn more about Android development I started to build an app to listen to
Podcasts from catalan radio RAC1. At the beginning it was just simple online streaming, afterwards
the downloading feature was added. It means that users were able to listen to podcasts offline which
they had previously downloaded.

After a few months I decided to reuse the same code to create another app to listen to podcasts 
from another catalan radio station, Catalunya RÃ dio.

The same Android project is configured to contain two flavours for the two different radio stations. Same code, different endpoints.
